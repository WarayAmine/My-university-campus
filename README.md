# My-university-campus
This is an Android application for everyone ( students, teachers ... ) be able to signal
if there is something to be fixed inside the university campus.
With simple UI/UX, it will be so easy to use this application when navigating through all the problems/tasks signaled by other users, 
remove a problem if we fixed it or if it's not existing anymore but still showing on the app, or add a new one.
